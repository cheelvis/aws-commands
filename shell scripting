#How  to run user defined shell script as a system command
eg how to get free RAM size in MB(magabytes)
run free -m, you will have an output as shown below

              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            978         127         422           0         427         709
Swap:             0           0           0
since you want to know only the free RAM size, run; free -m | awk 'NR==2{print $4, "MB(megabytes)"}'
create a shell script and put the above command inside. vi freeramsize, make the file exercutable, sudo chmod 755 <freeramsize>
copy the command to one of the predefined locations. to see the predefined locations, the command is echo $PATH. for ubuntu, you will as shown below.
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin.

create a directory call bin and move the file there, mkdir bin, move freeramsize bin/
