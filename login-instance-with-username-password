HOW TO LOG INTO AN EC2 INSTANCE WITH USERNAME AND PASSWORD

1: sudo useradd pride (where pride is the username) 
2: sudo passwd pride (specify a password for pride) 
3: go into the configuration file of the instance using the command ( cd /etc) 
4: cd ssh 
5: sudo vi sshd_config 
6: serach for password ( :/password) 
7: change passwordAuthentication from no to yes save the changes and leave. And restart sshd ( sudo service sshd restart) 
8: go back to etc ( cd ..) and sudo vi sudoers, search for wheel. edit what wheel can do to what pride can do. eg run all commands without a password. 
9: you can skip line 8 and simply add pride to the wheel group using the command ( sudo usermod –a –G wheel pride). 
Uncomment the part that says wheel should run all commands without a password and commend the one that is talking about group.
 
 In other to make sure that you can use the image of an instance that is using username and password to login,  
cd /etc/cloud 
Sudo vi cloud.cfg 
Change ssh_pwauth to true.
