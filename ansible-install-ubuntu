# First install ansible with the following commands
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$sudo apt-get install ansible -y
# install python if not present

After installing ansible, open the ansible.cfg file and make the following changes;
1- uncommend and change the inventory location as per your company. eg /opt/inventory.txt (don't forget to craete the file inventory.txt)
2- fork from 5 to any # accepted by your company (it is the # of servers ansible can perform configuration on at the same time.
3- host_key_checking = false, uncommend it.
4- ssh timeout = 10, uncommend it
5- log_path = /var/log/ansible.log, uncommand it. you can also change it to a desired location eg /opt/ansible.log
6- deprecation_warning = True, uncommend it

create goups in your inventory file using square brackets eg 
[webservers_prd] 
[webservers_qa] 
[webservers_dev]
you can also create a group of groups eg
[webservers:children]
webservers_prd
webservers_qa
webservers_dev

generate and exchange ssh keys using $ssh-keygen after generating the key, it will be in /root/.ssh and the key will be in the id_rsa_.pub file. copy the key and add it to the Authorized key location of all the servers to be controlled by ansible. after copying the key, try to log using $ssh <ip-of-server-you-want-to-login>
don't forget to enable password authentication for your servers.

Ansible adhoc commands
$ansible <group-name-in-inventry-file> -m <module-name> -a "<options>" eg
ansible webservers -m ping
ansible apservers -m service -a "path=/opt/abc.txt state=touch"

you can check your YML syntax using $ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --syntax-check. if you get back the name of the playbook, then your syntax is correct.
